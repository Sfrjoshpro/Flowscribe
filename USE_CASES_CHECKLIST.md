# Flowscribe Use Cases Checklist

Below are practical use cases for integrating Flowscribe into a project. Use this checklist to guide your implementation and testing:

## âœ… Use Cases

- [ ] **Data Pipeline Monitoring**
  - Trace each ETL step (extract, transform, load) as a flow.
  - Mark successes, failures, and metrics for each stage.

- [ ] **API Request Tracing**
  - Record each incoming API request as a session.
  - Track flows for authentication, validation, processing, and response.

- [ ] **Business Logic Validation**
  - Mark key business rules as flows (e.g., order submission, payment processing).
  - Capture checkpoints and evidence for each rule.

- [ ] **Error and Exception Analysis**
  - Log exceptions and failures as events with context and evidence.
  - Summarize root causes and failure patterns.

- [ ] **Performance Benchmarking**
  - Use metric events to record timing, counts, and resource usage.
  - Identify latency outliers and bottlenecks.

- [ ] **AI-Assisted Debugging**
  - Generate Copilot-ready summaries and prompts for failed runs.
  - Use artifacts to guide AI in proposing fixes and tests.

- [ ] **Privacy and Compliance Auditing**
  - Redact sensitive data in traces.
  - Demonstrate compliance with evidence and event logs.

- [ ] **Onboarding and Documentation**
  - Use flow traces and artifacts to help new team members understand system behavior.
  - Document flow names, success criteria, and failure classes in the flow catalog.
